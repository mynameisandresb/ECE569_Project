# README.md for running respective code bases is located in ./cuda and ./HOG-Feature

# Make sure terminal is in either the cuda directory or the HOG-Feature directory to properly execute their README

# Below code is if you want to run optimized versions only, follow these steps exactly (must be on hpc if you want it to just work)

# Follow README in each directory however for more detailed instructions
```
# Execute cuda kernels
cd cuda
./build.sh
./run.sh 1

cd ..

# Execute hog kernels
cd HOG-Feature
./build.sh
./run.sh 1
