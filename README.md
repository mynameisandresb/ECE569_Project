A parallelized motion detection implementation of <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6595847/">Yi et al.â€™s dual-mode SGM background subtraction model</a>. 

If you use their implementation please cite:

  author={Henderson, Peter and Vertescher, Matthew},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05156},
  year={2017}
}
```

The CUDA implementation of their code is in the cuda folder. Both the serial and parallelized tbb versions of their code reside in the same folder: serial_and_tbb. They can both be seen in the main.cpp and DualSGM.cpp files.
