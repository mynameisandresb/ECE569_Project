To build and run. Make sure you have CUDA and OPEN_CV and CMAKE installed. You can probably get away with not having CMAKE if you're running Mac OS X 10.9 with installation paths through HomeBrew. However, if not.

mkdir build
cd build
module load cuda11/11.0
CC=gcc cmake3 ..
make clean
make
../bin/BGS

if it doesn't work may need to export paths or add opencv and nvcc to your search paths

export OpenCV_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.6.1/

Make sure you have the appropriate image sequences and then update the paths in the main.cpp file

NOTE: we've included the binary file, but you will have to rebuild likely using cmake as per the instructions above
