THE ORIGINAL KERNEL VERSIONS CODE SOURCED FROM https://github.com/cchinmai19/GPU-Parallel-Programming

To build and run. Make sure you have CUDA and OPEN_CV and CMAKE installed

mkdir build
cd build
module load cuda11/11.0
CC=gcc cmake3 ..
make clean
make

The binary is located in 
/HOG-Feature/bin/HOG

To run move to bin folder:
cd ../bin

Run command:
./HOG <Cal_kernel_v#> <Cell_kernel_v#> <Block_kernel_v#> <Display_Cell_kernel_v#> <display_kernel_v#>

For example with all original kernel versions:
./HOG 0 0 0 0 0

For optimized versions used:
./HOG 1 2 3 1 1

Valid version numbers that can be used for inputs:
Cal_kernel_v#: 0 or 1
Cell_kernel_v#: 0, 1, or 2
Block_kernel_v#: 0, 1, 2, or 3
Display_Cell_kernel_v#: 0 or 1
display_kernel_v#: 0, 1, or 2

The different kernel versions:
1.	Cal_kernel_v0
2.	Cal_kernel_v1
3.	Cell_kernel_v0
4.	Cell_kernel_v1
5.	Cell_kernel_v2
6.	Block_kernel_v0
7.	Block_kernel_v1
8.	Block_kernel_v2
9.	Block_kernel_v3
10.	Display_Cell_kernel_v0
11.	Display_Cell_kernel_v1
12.	display_kernel_v0
13.	display_kernel_v1
14.	display_kernel_v2

The HOG features can be found in the bin folder after running:
HOG Features written to Feature.txt
HOG Features written to Display_feature.txt
HOG Features written to output.bmp
