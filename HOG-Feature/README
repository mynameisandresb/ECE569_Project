CODE SOURCED FROM https://github.com/cchinmai19/GPU-Parallel-Programming

To build and run. Make sure you have CUDA and OPEN_CV and CMAKE installed

mkdir build
cd build
module load cuda11/11.0
CC=gcc cmake3 ..
make clean
make

The binary is located in 
/HOG-Feature/bin/HOG

Once Make is successful, run the binary 
../bin/HOG <file name> <0 or 1> //Parameter 0 to not feature files, 1 to output feature files 

Example:
 ../bin/HOG ../HOG/gs_ua.1.jpg 1

In /HOG/main.cu, function hog_feature_pull(image_data, d1_flag) is what is needed for our project code. It takes in the image data, runs against the SVM, and outputs the 0 or 1 for the classification. 

===============================
train_HOG.cpp
- Couldn't get around figuring out how to convert the libjob to feature vector that is usable for this HOG program. CV has a train HOG that creates an SVM. Running through that to create a new SVM to compare against.
